Bed material load, which comprises bed load and suspended load, has been extensively studied in the past few decades and many equations have been developed, but they differ from each other in derivation and form. If a process can be related to various flow conditions on a general basis, a proper understanding of bed material load movement can be ascer- tained. In this paper, three different neural networks (NNs) Models including Multi-layer percepterons, and generalized feed forward neural network using dominant parameters of bed load formulas for River were developed. Neural network modelling, which is particularly use- ful in modelling processes about which knowledge of the physics is limited, is presented here as a complimentary tool for modelling bed material load transport. The developed model demonstrated a superior performance compared to other traditional methods based on dif- ferent statistical criteria, such as the coefficient of determination, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient and discrepancy ratio. The significance of the different input parameters has been anal- ysed in the present work to understand the influence of these parameters on the transport process.The optimum models were found through data sets of flow discharge, flow velocity, water surface slopes, flow depth, and mean grain size .For this river by conducted compari- son between measured and predicted values was approved where the Neural models presented more consistence and closer estimation to observed data.

Waste plastics are generated both by domestic and industrial sectors and used as construction material for the flexible pavement. Waste plastics used for packing purpose are made up of Poly ethylene, Poly propylene and Poly styrene etc. Their softening point generally varies from 110°C and 140°C and they do not emit toxic gases while softening.  \r\nIn this project, I have used LDPE (Low Density poly ethylene) to improve the properties of the bitumen and bituminous mix. LDPE was obtained from Plastic carry bags and plastic cups only (For this research). In this research the effect of LDPE (obtained from various sources i.e. from plastic carry bags, plastic cups) on the properties of bitumen and bituminous mix is compared by varying their proportions and results were compared. Bitumen was modified and three tests were performed. These tests were penetration test, Softening point test and ductility test. For each of the test, changes in the properties of the bitumen by the addition of various types of LDPE in varying proportions were observed. LDPE was added 2.5%, 5%. 7.5%, 10% and 12.5% by weight of bitumen and then changes in the properties of bitumen on the addition of various types of LDPE were compared.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo check the performance of aggregate, several tests were performed on conventional. These tests include a specific gravity test, water absorption test, aggregate crushing test, aggregate impact test and Deval’s abrasion test. For each of the test, the results were then compared with the limiting values.\r\n\r\nMORTH gradation was adopted for the mix and the optimum bitumen content of the mix was then calculated and Marshall mix design test for various types of LDPE used as a bituminous mix modifier were conducted.

Next, by imposing PCA and binarization operations, the real-valued features are converted into compact hash code used for speeding up the face search. Based on the extracted dual features, the face search can be efficiently performed by adopting two-stage matching (i.e., coarse matching and fine matching) strategy. The coarse matching is implemented under the support of efficient hash indexing technique for yielding a small number of candidates while the fine stage is to filter out the unrelated images by linear scan comparison of real-valued features.

This system provides the walls with better ductility and hence improves their seismic performance. Confined masonry walls have known to perform better than the unreinforced masonry (URM) and even the RC framed infilled walls in moderate to high magnitude earthquakes. Based on its respectable performance in past seismic events and advantages like a marginal cost increase and simple construction practices, confined masonry has evolved into a suitable alternative to the URM. Howbeit, there is still lack of proper guidelines for design of some aspects of the confined masonry system, especially, when it comes to the design of Tie columns. Recommendations suggest provision of nominal reinforcement irrespective of factors like column location, span of wall between two columns etc. The present study investigates the behaviour of CM walls with respect to the variation of the span of masonry wall between two confining columns. The study includes an experimental part and an analytical program. Experimental analysis serves the purpose of determining the numerical factors like ductility, structural damage and vibration of wall and strain in column reinforcement with the wall being subjected to increasing displacement amplitude and also probes into the cracking pattern of the wall under the rising seismic load. This will assist in the evaluation of the in-plane performance of Confined Masonry walls at different aspect ratios under seismic loading. The analytical study aims to propose a simplified model for the linear analysis of confined masonry walls in commercially available software. \r\nThe experimental study included three half-scale brick masonry wall specimens constructed in accordance with the guidelines of Confined masonry system. The aspect ratio of these specimen were 1.5, 1.2 and 0.86. These specimens were subjected to an incremental amplitude of displacement following a particular load cycle. The cracking sequence of the walls during the tests were noted and the results of the tests yielded the load dissipation pattern of the walls. All of the specimens maintained their structural integrity even when damaged unlike the URM and the masonry infill RC frames where parts of masonry walls have known to have fallen out causing major life and property losses. \r\nThe analytical study consisted of three full-scale CM walls with aspect ratio 2.2, 1.57 and 1.0. For each aspect ratio, two models were studied; a Shell model designed according to a CM wall where the shell element simulated the masonry wall; and a Strut model containing vertical and diagonal struts to simulate the masonry wall for further nonlinear studies. The models were subjected to a particular uniformly distributed gravity loading and a horizontal point load to simulate the loading conditions during any seismic event. Various parameters like axial force in columns and wall stiffness have been compared among the Shell and Strut models to arrive at a rational design procedure for the analysis of CM walls. The results reveal a feasible method, which can be further used in the nonlinear analysis as well.   \r\n', 'singhal@iitp.ac.in', '', 0, '43844943fb3fe6bd51bdae225d60308a', '');

Construction using AAC blocks is economical as compared to clay bricks, construction speed using this technology is faster and brick work is easier. Unfortunately, there is also a negative aspect of AAC block masonry: such walls are characterized with low crack resistance, especially in case of shearing loads. This is a common problem in the buildings located in the areas of seismic influences (Patna is in seismic zone 4). One of the possible solutions to improve the crack resistance of the masonry walls made of AAC blocks is application of superficial strengthening using fabric reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM). This thesis presents the results of laboratory tests which investigated the effectiveness of strengthening with FRCM mesh. Three series of masonry specimens were tested: unstrengthen specimen, masonry wallets with strengthening on one side using sandwich method, i.e. Cement-based mortar and FRCM woven mesh and cement plaster; and specimens with strengthening also on one side but using different strengthening methodology which was Anchoring method, i.e. 3 mm diameter anchors and FRCM woven mesh and cement plaster. Increase in the strength of all types of superficially strengthened specimens i.e. Flexure, Diagonal compression test in comparison to the reference/control specimens was observed. The tests also showed a positive effect of superficial strengthening on the cracking pattern and type of failure modes of such wallette specimens. \r\n\r\n', 'singhal@iitp.ac.in', '', 0, 'cca5f6705960103f25e5ae37529c89d1', ''),

This method is useful for the soil investigation up to greater depths (depends upon the electrode spacings). The electrical resistivity method has been employed to determine the soil resistivity properties and to correlate it with the CPT cone resistance (qc) and the shear wave velocity (Vs). The resistivity pattern along the depth is also presented, which is helpful to determine the saturation/dry state of soil at a particular depth in terms of water table.\r\nThis is a fast and reliable technique of soil investigation, with cost effective benefits over the conventional methods. In recent studies, it has been widely used for the ground water investigation purposes. Therefore, this technique is being adopted by several construction projects and researchers in various geotechnical areas.\r\nThe project has been done to evaluate the variation of electrical resistivity of the soil strata and its properties from place to place inside the IIT Patna campus. This project work includes electrical resistivity experiments using the schlumberger array method and the data analysis to develop the correlation using MS Excel. The typical soil characterisation is also done by performing direct shear test, liquid limit and plastic limit tests and the grain size distribution.\r\nExperimental results show linear correlations of electrical resistivity with CPT cone resistance and shear wave velocity. The correlations are having coefficient of determination (R2) value more than 0.8 in case of CPT cone resistance and more than 0.87 in case of shear wave velocity, which indicates that the linear relationships developed in this project have good reliability. Currently, many construction activities are going on in the IIT campus and many more are yet to be done in the near future.

The performance and durability of an asphalt mix is predominantly influenced by these mechanical and volumetric properties. Maximizing the density seemed to be the principle behind ï¬nding the optimal gradation earlier. As it was believed that would provide a better performing mix due to a denser gradation. However, several studies reported low Voids in Mineral Aggregate (VMA) owing to the maximum density. Which in turn resulted in low Binder Content (Pb) and Air Void (Va). Various researchers extensively studied the effect of aggregate gradation on strength and permanent deformation, as well as the volumetric parameters, in asphalt mixes. Packing of coarse and ï¬ne aggregate very clearly relate to the void in compacted asphalt mix and its aggregate interlocking. Based on this fact some researchers have emphasized on the importance of aggregate gradationâ€™s packing characteristics.  \r\nAlthough some estimate of various properties of compacted mix is provided by the current gradation design methods, a trial and error process is essentially required to establish an optimum blend. Further, it cannot accurately predict various properties of mixes without laboratory tests but it may be useful in comparing different gradations. It is noticeable that selecting an aggregate gradation which satisfies with volumetric and mechanical requirement depend majorly on experience. Random selection is nearly impossible. This is because absorption properties, texture, shape and speciï¬c gravity are some of several factors that mix formulation depends on. Therefore, constructing a design aid tool using the local past experience is important. \r\nA model which can satisfactorily estimate volumetric properties with simple input parameters is fit to be used to conduct a virtual mix design. Then this model can be used to predict optimized characteristics (objectives) for the mix. The model, once trained, would be able to assess various self-generated asphalt mix possibilities by changing various model inputs.

With the advancement of 5G technology, the telecommunication industry achieved a boost in capacity. Millimeter Wave (mmWave) massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems is one of the promising technique in 5G wireless communication systems. Operating at the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30-300 GHz), this novel technology provides wider bandwidth and higher spectral efficiency in the next-generation 5G wireless communication systems. But, the use of large number of antennas in such systems results in an equally large number of radio frequency (RF) chains for conventional fully digital systems. This results in huge hardware cost and unaffordable energy consumption, which leads to very poor energy efficiency (EE). The technique of Hybrid Precoding (HP) forms an interconnection between analog and digital processing for the next-generation 5G wireless communication systems. HP is widely used in millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems to supress the number of radio frequency (RF) chains and make the system both cost and energy efficient. Moreover, if non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is combined with MIMO, the spectral efficiency displays a sharp rise compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques. However, the analog phase shifters (APSs) used to realize analog precoder in conventional HP techniques are still energy-intensive. In this paper, we leverage switches and inverters (SI) instead of APSs to further raise the energy efficiency. Then, the probabilities of all hybrid precoder elements are updated by adaptive cross-entropy (ACE) algorithm using smoothed updating procedure, so as to minimize the cross-entropy (CE). This ACE-SI-based HP scheme is implemented in mmWave massive MIMO-NOMA system integrated with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), where users can concurrently decode data and harvest power to charge up its nodes by bifurcating the received signal power. Simulation results justify that the proposed ACE-SI-based HP scheme achieves near-optimal sum-rate performance, but higher energy efficiency than the existing schemes.', 'sudhir@iitp.ac.in', '', 0, 'ba53d8f0541ec5bcd6c3b743d5daae8b', ''),
